Received from JP Concordet. A few guides that they tested in the musum with T7
assays, but not with a single standard procedure. Probably not high-quality
data.

transformed manually to ../museum*.tab

NOTES: had to change GGCCCCACTGTGGGGTGGAGAGG to GGCCCCACTGTGGGGTGGAGGGG to get a match in hg19
and GTTAATGTGGCTCTGGTTCTAGG -> GTTAATGTGGCTCTGGTTCTGGG
